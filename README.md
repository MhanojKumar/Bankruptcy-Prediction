# Bankruptcy
## Abstract
The original bankruptcy dataset contains 5436 observations of 13 variables. The primary goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between the bankruptcy indicator and a set of independent variables on the bankruptcy dataset by using R to perform Logistic regression, Classification Trees, and Neural networks. Depending upon the Mis-classification rate, ROC curve, and AUC value, the best model out of three was chosen.
